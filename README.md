# TOTK Sort Fixer  

**TOTK Sort Fixer** is a **subsdk mod (subsdk6) powered by exlaunch** that resolves the issue where items get lost after increasing the game data cap and then sorting.  

## 🚀 Installation  

1. Place the mod in the **exefs** folder.  
2. **Important:** The `main.npdm` file is shared between exefs mods.  
   - If your exefs folder already contains `main.npdm`, either **overwrite it** or **skip copying it** to avoid conflicts.  

## ⚠️ Limitations  

- **Only armor items are supported** – The sort cap is increased to **600 armor items**.  
- **Other inventory categories (e.g., weapons, Zonai devices) are NOT supported yet but will be added later.**  
- ✅ Supports **all game versions from 1.0.0 to 1.2.1**.
